# The Cryptography Algorithms - Ruby

You can run and edit the cryptography algorithms or contribute.

### All cryptography algorithms are implemented in Ruby (for education purposes)
These implementations are for learning purposes. The implementations may be less efficient than the Ruby standard library.

## Structure
All cryptography algorithms are implemented with a proper format [directory](STRUCTURE.rb)

## Algorithms
See our [directory](DIRECTORY.md).
